# Machine Learning

# Objectives
Students will be able to
- explain the linear regression model
- explain the k-nearest neighbors model very technically
- explain the popular data science algorithms conceptually to a layman
- use the scikit-learn library to generate predictive models
- explain the datascience ecosystem and terminology
- tie their pandas, sklearn, and plotting knowledge together

# Agenda
1. What is data science? (conceptual examples, terminology, thought experiments) (40m)
2. Intro linear regression via boston housing data (45m)
3. Linear regression practice on new data set (30m)
4. Technical explanation of kNN via worksheet (if necessary) (30m)
5. Intro to sklearn - what is it? (20m)
6. Classification on cancer data with kNN from sklearn, learning `.fit`, `.predict` and `cross_val_score` and `cross_val_predict` (90m)
7. Group reading and discussion of popular data science algorithms (60m)
8. How to use logistic regression classifier (30m)
9. Classification exercise on new dataset; use RandomForest, kNN, Logistic, DecisionTree, NaiveBayesClassifier and SVC by consulting the documentation. (60m)
