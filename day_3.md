# Advanced Pandas & Visualization

# Objectives
Students will be able to
- reshape dataframes via pivot tables, groupby, stack and unstack as necessary
- run timeseries analysis using timestamps, grouping, and periods
- create basic plots directly from the dataframe
- create more compelling visualizations with either plotly or seaborne

# Agenda
0. Pandas warm-up and review (30m)
1. Crunchbase dataset to learn how to reshape dataframes (60m)
2. Citibike dataset to learn how to use timestamps (60m)
3. Intro to Pandas integrations, e.g. [Google Analytics](http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/pandas-google-analytics.html)
4. Plotting via pandas dataframe, exploring the different options ([some resources](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/visualization.html)) (45m)
5. Intro to visualization Plot.ly - why Plotly, solo walk-through of tutorial, together walk-through of complex/interesting example, then exercises (120m)
