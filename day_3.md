# Advanced Pandas & Visualization

# Objectives
Students will be able to
- reshape dataframes via pivot tables, groupby, stack and unstack as necessary
- run timeseries analysis using timestamps, grouping, and periods
- create basic plots directly from the dataframe
- create more compelling visualizations with either plotly or seaborne

# Agenda
1. Pandas warm-up and review (30m)
2. Crunchbase dataset to learn how to reshape dataframes (60m)
3. Rocksongs dataset to learn basics of datamunging (45m)
3. Citibike dataset to learn how to use timestamps (60m)
4. Plotting via pandas dataframe, exploring the different options (45m)
5. Intro to visualization Plot.ly - why Plotly, solo walk-through of tutorial, together walk-through of complex/interesting example, then exercises (120m)
